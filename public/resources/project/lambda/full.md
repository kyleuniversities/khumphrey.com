The Lambda Application is a multipurpose Springboot API that can perform virtually any
software text-to-text function. The app was made with Typescript React for the frontend
and Springboot for the backend. Additionally, the Lambda Application can be used as
a command line for virtually any software task.

## Major Use Cases

The Lambda Application is a convenient tool for software development. A major use case
of the Lambda Application is code generation. With the Java Controller API, one only needs
to create a small class stub with instance fields, and it can generate an entire Java class
with the factory pattern method, constructor, accessors, and mutators.

Another major use case for the Lambda Application is large-scale file related tasks. With
the File Controller API, one can search an entire directory of text files and replace a target
token with a replacement token, with the option of the original text files being backed.

Other than the above, there are several more functions from the Lambda Application that can
help coders with software development.
