# Lambda

![](../resources/project/lambda/image.png)

The Lambda Application is a multipurpose Springboot API that can perform virtually any
software text-to-text function. The app was made with Typescript React for the frontend
and Springboot for the backend. Additionally, the Lambda Application can be used as
a command line for virtually any software task.

# Technologies Utilized

Throughout the development of this application, I incorporated various frontend/backend technologies
including:

- **Typescript React**: Invoked the use of Typescript React classes, functions, and types.
- **Semantic UI**: Invoked Semantic UI as a framework on top of React for components.
- **Spring Boot**: Invoked the use of Spring Boot for the backend API.

# Practices Utilized

Throughout the development of this application, I incorporated various coding practices including:

- **MVC Architecture**: Incorporated MVC architecture on frontend module structure.
- **SOLID Programming**: Incorporated SOLID programming for the libraries in the backend API.
- **Encapsulation**: All classes in the backend API are perfectly encapsulated.
- **Helper Classes**: Operations of a specific type are unified into a Helper class API.
- **Factory Pattern**: All objects are generated via factory methods.

## List of API Controllers

The Lambda Application acts a hub for various API Controllers that perform specific types of
functions. The list of API Controllers currently within the Lambda Application are as follows:

- Integer Controller
- Double Controller
- String Controller
- Java Controller
- File Controller

## Major Use Cases

The Lambda Application is a convenient tool for software development. A major use case
of the Lambda Application is code generation. With the Java Controller API, one only needs
to create a small class stub with instance fields, and it can generate an entire Java class
with the factory pattern method, constructor, accessors, and mutators.

Another major use case for the Lambda Application is large-scale file related tasks. With
the File Controller API, one can search an entire directory of text files and replace a target
token with a replacement token, with the option of the original text files being backed.

Other than the above, there are several more functions from the Lambda Application that can
help coders with software development.
