# Docupaxx

![](../resources/project/docupaxx/image.png)

Docupaxx is a full stack web application assigned for my Software Engineering Class CSC 648 in San
Francisco State University. I had been assigned as team leader for a team of 7 students to build
a web application for the semester practicing and learning best software engineering practices.
The application was built using ReactJS for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend.

## Milestones

Over the course of the semester, our team (Team 7) was assigned perform 5 competitive Milestones
where we accomplished various tasks in our respective websites. We competed against 5 other teams
(Teams 1 - 6 with Team 3 dropped out), and after much hard work from our team, we managed to win on Milestone 4.

&nbsp;

### Milestone 1: Documentation

Our first milestone was creating stubs various sections in our website documentation. Team 6
was able to win in that milestone.

&nbsp;

### Milestone 2: Vertical Prototype

Our second milestone mainly involved expanding our documentation and building a vertical prototype
for the app. Another team won that Milestone, but our Team 7 was noted to be a runner up.

&nbsp;

### Milestone 3: Horizontal Prototype

Our third milestone involved expanding our documentation more and building a horizontal prototype
for the app. During this milestone, our team had worked very hard and improved on many aspects
in relation to Milestone 2. However, Team 6 had won the 3rd milestone (our Team 7 being second
place again).

&nbsp;

### Milestone 4: Quality Assurance Testing

For our 4th milestone, we polished the app in both the frontend and backend for quality assurance
testing. We followed all the requirements and went beyond what was asked for. For the 4th
milestone, both our Team 7 and Team 6 had won.

&nbsp;

### Milestone 5: Final Product

For the 5th and last Milestone, we wrapped up the application including all the features we could
and polished up our documentation. It was very hard work for all our members, but Team 6
had won the final milestone.

## Overall

Overall I was able to learn very much from the experience. I was able to truly understand ReactJS
and ExpressJS code, involving operations including file encoding, ORMs, and large-scale code
organization. I gained much experience helping manage both our inner frontend and backend teams.
