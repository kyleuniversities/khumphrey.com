The AMATYC Math Competition is a national math competition that takes place every year in
two-year colleges such as City College of San Francisco. The contest consists of two rounds,
the first round taking place in the Fall semester, and the second round in the Spring. The
contest is an hour-long test of 20 competitive math questions. Getting a question correct
raises your score by 2 points, whilst getting a question wrong decreases your score by 0.5 points.
