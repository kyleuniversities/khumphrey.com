# Quizzical

![](../resources/project/quizzical/image.png)

The Quizzical Application is a Springboot web application designed for users to be able to quiz
themselves by making their own quizzes. The app was developed using Typescript React for
the frontend and Springboot for the backend. I have undertaken this project to help myself become
more experienced with the Springboot framework.

## Progress Completed

This project is still in its early stages. I have designed the style stubs for the frontend interface
and have created a API functionality for the Question data entity. Currently, I am working on
implementing login with Spring Security using Spring Session.
