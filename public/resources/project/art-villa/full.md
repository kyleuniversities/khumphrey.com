# Art Villa

![](../resources/project/art-villa/image.png)

The Art Villa Application is a social media web application designed for artists to be able to
post their artwork online. It is meant to be a full-fledge web application involving the dependencies
required for an enterprise website. It is built using ReactJS and ExpressJS.

## Progress Completed

This project is still in its early stages. I have designed the style stubs for the frontend interface
and have created a API functionality for the Post data entity. Currently, I am working on
implementing login with sessions.
