# Technologies

![](../resources/info/technologies/image.png)

While I have coding experience in Java for over 7 years, I have experience in a
wide variety of software technologies including the following:

- Java
- ReactJS
- Python
- MySQL
- ExpressJS
- AWS

&nbsp;

## Java

I'm an avid Java coder, my first experience of Java coding dating back in Fall 2016. Over
the years, I've developed many classroom and personal Java projects and have evolved
my coding style many times.

I've learned the principles of SOLID programming as well as use of best practices such
as encapsulation, code readibility, and code reuse. My style of Java programming involves extensive use of Helper classes (to provide a conveninent functional interface and coding documentation at the same time) as well as using the Factory Pattern when instantiating objects (provide ease of code by leveraging suggestions generated from IDEs).

I have found that my extensive experience and knowledge in Java has helped me learn other coding
languages fast, as I am able more easily able to articulate what patterns are needed to solve
a specific coding requirement/need.

## ReactJS

This website was made with a combination of ReactJS, Typescript, and Semantic UI. My first coding true
coding experience with React was in Spring 2021 when I was the team leader in my Software Engineering
class. We were assigned to make a website, and I had to keep up with my the frontend lead's code in
order to help out and guide others. Thanks to my prior experience in developing a lot with Java,
I was able to quickly understand the mechanics of my frontend lead's code, develop the frontend app with
him, as well as guide the others on how to do specific steps.

I also undertook a small React project in one of my Full Stack Development Certificate courses, and have
undertook a few personal projects with ReactJS.

## Python

I have had to use Python for several of my university classes and projects in my Full Stack Development
Certificate courses. Projects involving Python code include developing methods for AI concepts, NLP
concepts, and writing code for Data Analysis experiments in Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, several
courses in my Full Stack Certificate course set center around Python, requiring me to submit projects
involving frameworks such as Django and Flask.

## MySQL

I have used MySQL technologies for various large-scale university projects. I have experience
in both using MySQL queries directly and using an ORM technology to provide ease-of-use for
backend applications connecting to the database. I have used MySQL in my Software Engineering
web application, and am also using it in personal projects.

&nbsp;

## ExpressJS

I have used ExpressJS technologies for multiple large-scale university projects as the backend
programming language. I have used ExpressJS in my Software Engineering web application, and am using it
for personal projects as well.

&nbsp;

## AWS

My first experience in AWS was when I was a Backend Intern for Fabrix Health in 2018. I have went
on to later use AWS technologies more in university projects, and I have brushed up on many relevant
AWS web technologies including EC2, RDS, IAM, and Code Deploy.
