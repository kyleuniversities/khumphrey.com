# About Me

![](../resources/info/about-me/image.png)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hi, my name is Kyle Humphrey (@kyleuniversities) and welcome to my
website! I'm a hard worker and fast learner who loves to solve
complex problems. I have significant experience in Java, ReactJS,
and Python.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know what you're thinking. What makes me different from all the
other coders out there? Well ... Nothing much. Sorry to disappoint you. Nothing to see here. Nope.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm a passionate coder and developer who
loves challenges and believes I'm at least ... fairly proficient at solving them. I like to take
the time to really understand things for how they are and do things in the right way. I
love both Math and Computer Science as subjects. I once ranked in the top 1% of scorers in the national
AMATYC Math Competition (2018-2019). And I'm an avid Java coder, having started coding in
Java since 2016. I used to be a Team Leader in my Software Engineering class in San Francisco State
University, as well as the Co-President of the Math Club in City College. So I have
a bit of team/leadership/full-stack experience that could be helpful.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During my free time, you can find me watching anime and YouTube, playing
Pokemon Violet, or practicing my fiction writing so I can one day write my own novel.
