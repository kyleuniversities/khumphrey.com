# Works in Progress

To practice/learn/demonstrate proper software engineering and programming practices, I have
undertaken several software engineering projects.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Broad Scope

I have undertaken projects using a variety of different languages and technologies including Java,
Springboot, Django, Typescript, and React JS. Thus, I split my coding work between the projects
below.

However, in the event that I accept a job offer for a company, I am able and willing to
hyperfocus on their preferred technological stack for better quality of development.
